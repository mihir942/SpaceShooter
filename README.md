# SpaceShooter

## What is this project about? 
Hi! On my quest to learn Pygame for the first time, I've created this simple SpaceShooter game in Python. It includes sound effects, background music and graphics. I did my best to write this code as cleanly as possible, so others can understand. 

## Credits
Will add the credits for the sounds, graphics and fonts soon. 

## Future updates
Perhaps I will add levels to the game. Even make it become harder with time (e.g. alien ships come in at a faster rate).
